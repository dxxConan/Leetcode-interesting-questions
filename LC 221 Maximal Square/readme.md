noticed that the question require the area of a square. 
so for a point at x, y with value 1. which means is the a square's right bottom point. 
And its length is 1 plus min value among length of square with right bottom point at (x-1,y) (x,y-1) (x-1,y-1)
and of course those length could be 0 as it may not a square.

and this question has a follow up like what if we wants the rectange instead of square.
