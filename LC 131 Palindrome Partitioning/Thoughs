### Problem description

Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

For example, given s = "aab",
Return
[
  ["aa","b"],
  ["a","a","b"]
]

#### thoughts
make this question as combination sum. What you need to do is to split the word, every time you split you need to verify 
if the substring you get is a palindrome one. for a string like aabbbcccc you can split as aa bbb cccc which is the combination of 2,5,9.
use dfs to get all possible combinations
